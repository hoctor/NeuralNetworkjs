# NeuralNetworkjs

This is a Multilayer perceptron used to build and app that stores and calculate sleeping behavior.
You can build and HTTP-server and run it.
obs:I dont know what version is this,cause i did so much work and so many versions of it.I followed a book of a Brazilian autor
but you can build it on your own with any book,video,blog you find.

It takes some calculation and programming knowloge to really understand whats going on here.
Everything is in JavaScript with HTML.
I've built it by hand so it may look a little strange cause it was my part of the project and the others didnt put theyr 
hands on it,so i freely did what I want with the code.


steps:
1- build any HTTP-server , you can do it as you like
2- run it
3- you can change HTML file for training
4- to much epochs may take some time to process

Thanks
any doubt contact me
